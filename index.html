    <h4> Soccer is one of our many incredibly fun team sports. The games are normally during the week, and if there is not a game they are down at Lily Field, where practices are held. There is a bus that runs everyday down to Lily Field, so kids that are unable to drive can get down their safely. Soccer is sport that anyone and everyone can pick up quiet easily with the right mindset. Soccer also is a great place to meet people of different ages and grow those special connections on and off the field. </h4>

    <h12>Altamont basketball creates such a great environment between the players and the student body. Students always support and have great team spirit for our games, and the turnouts are always incredible. Practices are constructive but also fun where we have the chance to scrimmage. We also participate in other team activities off the court where we create team chemistry. We support other athletics and have the chance to eat and go to other sports games around the city. The basketball teams range from 5th all the way to 12th grade. Altamont basketball creates an exciting collaborative experience that is welcoming to everyone. </h12>

    <h14> Volleyball has been a well-loved sport at Altamont forever. The season starts during the summer with team workouts, and it is a great time for team bonding as well. Volleyball is the first sports season of the school year, and with games being afterschool students love to come and cheer. It is a great environment for players of all skill levels to have fun and improve.

    <h14> Baseball has been a school favorite for many years. All though the team doesn’t always come out on top, they have fun doing it. Tryouts happen around November and December, and they start training after winter break. Practices are normally after school down at Comer Field. The baseball team is filled tons of hard workers who would love to welcome any new players.
